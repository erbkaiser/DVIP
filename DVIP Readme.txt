Deus Vult includes much of the work on the unofficial 1.06 Improvement Packs that were discussed after Crusader Kings' patch 1.05, but not everything made it in.

The intended scope of the DVIP is more or less the following:
-Historic characters at scenario start
-Historic realms and provinces at scenario start
-Edit or add events to allow cultures to change more-or-less historically (melting pots)
-Fix remaining Deus Vult bugs where possible (events, database files, CoAs)

This mod was originally based on the work compiled for CK 1.06 by Byakhiam, and would be impossible without the input of other CK: DV players.
An incomplete thanks list:
Aylo1, Bruit Bleu, Calgacus, Drachenfire, echopapa, FinnN, Hasimir Fenring, gigau, Jinnai, Joe Public, Llywelyn, Mohe, Mrdie, performer, Praetor, Rogan de Auria, tombom, Topher, Vasious, Veldmaarschalk, Walter Hawkwood
Apologies to anyone I left out.

DVIP is 'optimized' for an AI aggressiveness of Weakling (1) or Coward (2) -- I don't play with higher settings myself as it makes the AI go insane, and thus DVIP isn't tested for higher values.
You can pick any difficulty, events are scaled for it.

The DVIP is fully compatible with Crusader Kings Deus Vult with the 2.1 beta patch applied.
