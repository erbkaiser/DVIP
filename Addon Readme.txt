DVIP Addon

This is an addon for the DVIP and is not usable by itself.
It should be unzipped on top of an existing DVIP install, overwriting all files.

Included:

Event mods:
Jor:
-Break_free.txt: My break free mod. This makes it far more difficult to rule over immense realms covering all the map. More info at http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?t=326287
-Set_laws.txt: A small series of events that make sure bishoprics, republics, and knight orders have the right laws
-Varia.txt: a number of smaller event mods. Included two events to break up large AI realms, my fertility events, an event to add more courtiers to knight order courts, and my PC friend excommunicates event
-Female_inheritance.txt: A mod that allows female inheritance.

Wiz.txt:
A modified version of selection of Wiz's excellent mods:
-Makes AI demobilize during peace times
-Knights with Teeth mod
-Countering CKDV's crazy ass skills (my edits).

Thanks to Wiz for their permission to include their events with my mod.
